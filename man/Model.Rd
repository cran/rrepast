\title{The easy API for model initilization}
\usage{
Model(modeldir = "", maxtime = 300, dataset = "none", load = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{modeldir}{The installation directory of some repast model}

\item{maxtime}{The total simulated time}

\item{dataset}{The name of any model aggregate dataset}

\item{load}{If true instantiate model and load scenario}
}
\value{
Returns the instance of repast model
}
\description{
Instantiate a repast model from the model dir without
loading the scenario file.
}
\details{
This is the entry point for model execution. Typically
any model execution will start with this function which encapsulates
all low level calls for model initialization. In order to perform
simulations with repast from R code only \code{Model} and a
few more function calls are required: \code{\link{Load}},
\code{\link{Run}}. Finally the output of model is managed with
functions \code{\link{GetResults}} and \code{\link{SaveSimulationData}}.
